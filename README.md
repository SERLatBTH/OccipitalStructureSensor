# OccipitalStructureSensor


## SDK

Using the sdk you can create iOS Apps with 3D Sensing. Structure SDK for iOS comes complete with drop-in prefabs for Unity, and a robust SceneKit sample for use with Structure Sensor. You can even create ultra-low-latency Mixed reality apps with Bridge Engine and the Bridge headset, currently available as a separate package.

### Bridge Engine
Bridge Engine is Occipital's next-generation mixed and virtual reality software. Create new experiences with unprecedented 6-DoF movement and bring virtual characters, like our little friend Bridget, into the real world.
